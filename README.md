# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analyzer

A multiple linear regression in C# and Python that analyzes a given set amount of regressors to one dependent variable. 
Using gnuplot, it also creates plots of each regressor with the dependent variable, and plots of how the regressors changed chronologically at different data points.

P.S. I used this throughout a season of fantasy basketball, and it helped me get 1st place!
